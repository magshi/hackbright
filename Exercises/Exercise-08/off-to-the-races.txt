My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool
Glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you
Sitting sipping on your black Cristal, yeah

Light of my life, fire in my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire in my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted,
Facing time again on Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you want me, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again on Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement, Love you
But I'm going down

God I'm so crazy baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising Hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him till the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you

You're lyin' with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "Hun, you never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man"

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, chaos
Casino oasis
Honey it's time to spin
Boy you're so crazy baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You’re no good for me
Baby you’re no good for me
You’re no good for me
But baby I want you, I want

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
Cause we gonna take a ride
I’m not gonna listen to what the past says
I’ve been waiting up all night

Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he’s gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it’s gonna be alright

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Let’s take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we’re here for
Saved too many times

Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

You’re no good for me
Baby you’re no good for me
You’re no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you

You’re no good for me
Baby you’re no good for me
You’re no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you, I want you

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Baby stoppin’ at seven eleven
There in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?
